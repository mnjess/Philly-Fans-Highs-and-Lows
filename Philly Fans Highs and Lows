    <title>Philly Fan Highs and Lows</title>

    <h1>In Philly's nest, the Eagles take flight,</h1>
    <p>With players who give fans quite a fright.</p>
    <p>They strive for glory, with heart and soul,</p>
    <p>But sometimes their antics take on a funny role.</p>

    <p>The quarterback's passes, like a wild ride,</p>
    <p>Sailing through the air, on the game's wild tide.</p>
    <p>The linemen tackle with a hearty crunch,</p>
    <p>While the fans cheer on, their spirits in a bunch.</p>

    <p>Through wins and losses, come hail or rain,</p>
    <p>The Eagles and their antics drive us insane.</p>
    <p>But in the end, it's all in good fun,</p>
    <p>Because in Philly, we love our Eagles, everyone!</p>
